# Exercise: React Router

## Instructions

- Using the demo as an example, install and configure `react-router-dom` in your application.

- Create a browser router at your React app's entry point file (`src/index.js` or `src/main.jsx`)

- Render the Jeopardy component from the previous exercise at the `/jeopardy` path. 
    
- Create a couple more routes and add render new components at their path. 

- Create a '404' (page not found) page that displays when a user navigates to a route that does not exist.
